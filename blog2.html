        <h1>Are Indian's are innovative in solving their own problems?</h1>

    <div class="content">
         <p>A country with 1.3 billion population had contributed only 3.34% of R&D projects in the world, whereas South Korea has a population of about only 51 million but it contributes 3.33% of R&D projects. There are two problems for this situation, one is not having a good education standard and improper way of teaching and another reason is we Indians are not looking to find a solution for our problems and we always concentrate on Tier-1cities alone. Many Start-Up ideas are ready to solve problems of Our Tier-1 cities alone thus why more than 70 percentage of star-up are not succeeding. The fact is only 10 percent of the population is living in Tier-1 cities. Why start-up and innovators are not ready to solve the problem of small cities and villages. Because we Indian's getting mind map of Americans and European countries and we implement in our ideas and problems. The focus is not there what we need.</p>
         <p class = "quote"><q> Anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.</q><br> - J.K. Rowling </p>
         <p>Let's see the example of Chandigarh city Manholes, The city Chandigarh is with many small street and crowded area too since it is Capital city for 2 states (Punjab and Haryana). The newcomers come to the city feel difficult to travel one place to another inside the city. To eradicate this problem they find a solution as figuring the city map in the Manhole cover of the city. And also the point the current location of Manhole, so that people can move one place to another without using GPS. It's a great innovation for people who don't use GPS to find a way for their travel. Since in India, everybody didn't have Smart Phone only 48% of people are using Smart Phones (as per 2018 report). So India needs innovation for those who didn't use Smart Phones also, as their population is also in high and they are living in a bad lifestyle. So Engineers and Innovators is our duty to transform all parts of our nation makes a developed one.</p>
